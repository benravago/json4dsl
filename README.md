# json4dsl

Some tools for using json for dsl's.

A simple json dsl example shows how the basic json parser can be extended to relax the string quoting requirement and how to add 'identifier' data to json objects.

An extension to that demonstrates how an alternative to JavaFX fxml would look like; a JSON Bean Markup Language (jbml).

Use <code>make</code> to run some examples.
